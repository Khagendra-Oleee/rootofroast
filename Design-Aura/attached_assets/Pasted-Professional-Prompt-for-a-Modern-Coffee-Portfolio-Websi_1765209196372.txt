Professional Prompt for a Modern Coffee Portfolio Website (Premium, Cozy, Human-Made Aesthetic)
Project Overview

Create a high-end, modern, cozy, and immersive Coffee Portfolio Website designed to present coffee as an art form, a cultural experience, and a storytelling journey — not a commercial brand website.

The goal is to deliver a museum-quality digital experience that feels handcrafted, warm, and authentic — with animations and design that feel professionally crafted, not AI-generated.

1. Design Philosophy & Visual Aesthetics
Overall Style

Modern, warm, deeply aesthetic, and editorial.

A “digital coffee museum” vibe with artful curation.

Luxurious but minimal — no clutter, only intentional elements.

Color Palette

Coffee-inspired warm tones:
Deep espresso browns, cream beige, roasted caramel, muted olive/forest green, soft latte whites.

Subtle gradients for depth.

Background tones with fine grain textures for a handcrafted feel.

Typography

Elegant serif headings (editorial style).

Clean geometric sans-serif body text.

Large hero titles with smooth fade-in strokes.

Perfect readability and high contrast.

Imagery & Illustrations

High-quality lifestyle photography of coffee, beans, tools, and café ambience.

Hand-drawn accents or minimal line illustrations.

Realistic textures: wood, ceramic, raw coffee beans, paper fibers.

Human-Made Aesthetic

Avoid anything that looks “AI-generated”.

Use natural imperfections, organic shapes, soft shadows, and layered depth.

2. Animation & Interaction Requirements (Pro-Level, Smooth, Premium)
Core Animation Style

Cinematic, buttery smooth, intentional.

All animations must feel natural, physics-based, and lightweight.

Required Animations:
1. Smooth Scroll Reveal Animations

Text and images slide, fade, or scale into view.

Delayed stagger effects for elegance.

GSAP or Framer Motion recommended.

2. Parallax 3D Layered Motion

Backgrounds, coffee beans, and illustrations move at different speeds.

Multi-layer depth to create a 3D storytelling experience.

3. Liquid / Morphing Blob Backgrounds

Organic, slow-moving blobs used as:

Section transitions

Hero background

Highlight elements

Very subtle, elegant, non-distracting.

4. Magnetic Hover Interactions

Buttons, icons, coffee beans, or images follow cursor gravity.

Smooth, elastic interaction when hovering near elements.

5. Micro-Interactions

Button hover ripple, soft scaling, color shifts.

Coffee cards tilt slightly with cursor.

Icons animate subtly when interacted with.

6. Smooth Page Transitions

Fade between sections.

Slide transitions with blur.

Consistent flow to maintain immersion.

3. Website Content Structure (Premium Storytelling)
Hero Section

Full-screen hero image/video of brewing coffee.

Parallax steam rising subtly.

Morphing blobs behind title.

Magnetic hover on “Explore Coffee” button.

Minimal, luxurious headline text.

Coffee Types Section

Grid or carousel of coffee types (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, Pour-over, etc.).

Each card includes:

Photo

Short description

Smooth hover tilt

Small micro-animation on click

Cards slide into view with stagger effect.

World’s Top Coffee Beans

Interactive world map with parallax motion.

Clickable origins (Ethiopia, Colombia, Kenya, etc.).

High-res bean texture photos.

Storytelling layout: growing conditions, altitude, flavor notes.

Brewing Techniques Section

Step-by-step brewing visuals animated as user scrolls.

French press, pour-over, espresso, cold brew, etc.

Smooth scroll-triggered illustrations.

Light sound effects optional (steam, pour, grind).

Harvesting & Sourcing Section

Animated global map timeline.

Parallax images of plantations, farmers, handpicking.

Morphing blobs behind region visuals.

Elegant documentary-like storytelling.

Coffee Culture Section

Large typography blocks.

Smooth text reveal animations.

Photos and illustrations layered with parallax offset.

Cozy, narrative storytelling tone.

Contact / Subscribe Section

Warm minimal form.

Magnetic submit button.

Soft ripple or micro-interaction when interacting.

Subtle gradient/morphing shape background.

4. Technical Implementation Requirements
Performance

Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Lazy loading for media.

Optimized scripts and minimal blocking.

Perfectly smooth scroll and animations.

Tech Stack Suggestions

GSAP for scroll animations + parallax.

Framer Motion for interactions & component animations.

Three.js for subtle 3D depth or object layers.

Locomotive Scroll or Lenis for smooth scrolling.

UX & Accessibility

High contrast ratios.

Keyboard navigable.

Screen-reader friendly text content.

Large tap targets on mobile.

5. Final Goal (The Main Vision)

Create a professional, immersive, handcrafted, coffee-themed portfolio website that feels:

Warm

Cozy

Elegant

Human-made

Aesthetic

Story-driven

Premium and modern

Filled with cinematic, buttery animations

Beautifully polished with perfect attention to detail

The website should look like it was designed by a top-tier creative studio, blending storytelling, modern UI/UX, and high-quality coffee culture content — not AI-generated, but artistically crafted.
